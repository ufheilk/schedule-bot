2. How do you usually choose your campus dining location for lunch?
3 .Do you feel that long wait times hinder your ability to make it to get lunch between classes, especially Tuesday/Thursday (where the gap between classes is shorter)?  How do you usually overcome this hurdle?
4. If you knew a dining location you do not usually frequent had a very short waiting time, would you be inclined to go there?  Why/why not?
5. Would you be interested in a service that suggested where you should eat, based on waiting times on campus?
6. Would you be willing to report to the program how long you waited for food on campus?
7. Do you think that Vanderbilt students would be interested in a service such as this?  Why/why not?
8. Do you trust that other people partaking in this service would accurately report their waiting time data?
9. What information about dining locations during the lunch rush would you want to receive, if you could choose?
10. What would be an acceptable margin of error for such a service? (ex, the texting service says wait will be 10 minutes and wait is actually 15 - is this acceptable? What is the acceptable error?)

# Answers

## Question 1: 
  1. I usually eat at Rand. I get a Randwich: salami and American cheese on a pretzel roll, with tomato, sweet peppers, carrot, and a little bit of mayo. I get yogurt, a pear, and chocolate milk as sides.
  2. Yes, usually Rand.
  3. Yes. EBI TR/Rand MWF

## Question 2:
  1. My options are limited by the ~45 minute window I have for lunch. I pretty much only ever get Rand because of the time pressure.
  2. Food variety and how long it takes
  3. Proximity to last class/next class, quality
  
## Question 3:
  1. Wait times are the bane of my lunchtime experience. I usually suck it up and wait in line, but I make myself feel better by complaining to my friends.
  2. Yes, Iâ€™ve been late to class several times. I normally go to get lunch in the last 20 minutes of the dining
period for shorter lines and eat quickly outside of my classroom
  3. Not as much because I eat fast
  
## Question 4:
  1. Absolutely. I will eat anything, and shorter wait times are a much bigger priority for me than food taste or quality.
  2. Yes, if the walk is reasonable! 
  3. Yes, if the quality is up to par and it is at a convenient location
  
## Question 5:
  1. Yes. This sounds like a great idea.
  2. Yes
  3. Yes, especially if these times were accurate
  
## Question 6: 
  1. Not every day, but for an initial trial period I would consider it.
  2. Yes
  3. Absolutely
  
## Question 7:
  1. I think they would be interested, especially because every complains so much about the incredible lines at lunchtime
  2. Yes, I think a lot of students face this problem.
  3. Yes, there are a decent number of places to eat and many times the wait time can play a significant role in the decision-making process. 
  
## Question 8: 
  1. Yes. I don't think they would have a reason to lie, and obvious trolls would probably be easy to spot.
  2. Yes
  3. There shouldn't be any reason to under-report wait times. They might be slightly over-reported, but in this case that is preferable and once acknowledged, won't matter much. 
  
## Question 9:
  1. Wait time and food options (especially for places that have a rotation or new food options each day).
  2. Just wait times would be fine!
  3. Just average time to be served since joining the line
  
## Question 10:
  1. I would be okay with a normal 5 minute discrepancy. A 10 minute discrepancy would be acceptable if it was rare. 
  2. I think within 10 minutes of the estimated time is acceptable.
  3. <5 min
